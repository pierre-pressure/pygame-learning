Learning game development with Python and Pygame - step by step projects from basics to RPG

## 🎯 Goal

Building foundational game development skills through small, focused projects that gradually increase in complexity. The ultimate goal is to create an isometric action RPG with Diablo-3 style gameplay, round-based dungeons like Brotato, and a risk-based crafting system similar to Metin2.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Python 3.x** - Programming language
- **Pygame** - Game development library
- **Future**: Potential integration with AI/ML libraries for intelligent NPCs

## 📚 Learning Path

Each project is designed to be completed from scratch to reinforce fundamental concepts:

### Phase 1: Core Mechanics
1. **Hello Game Window** - Pygame basics, game loop
2. **Moving Square** - Player movement, input handling
3. **Bouncing Ball** - Collision detection with boundaries
4. **Square vs. Square** - Object-to-object collisions
5. **Simple Shooter** - Projectiles, object lists

### Phase 2: Game Systems
6. **Chase Game** - Basic AI (enemy follows player)
7. **Health & Damage** - Combat system fundamentals
8. **Collectibles** - Item pickup mechanics
9. **Simple Inventory** - UI and data structures
10. **Basic Crafting** - Item combination system

### Phase 3: Advanced Features
11. **Isometric View** - Coordinate transformation
12. **Tile-based World** - Map systems
13. **AI Companion** - Chat integration
14. **RPG Elements** - Stats, experience, leveling

## 🎮 Project Structure

Each project follows this structure:
```
XX-project-name/
├── main.py          # Main game file
├── README.md        # Project-specific documentation
└── [other files]    # Additional modules as needed
```

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Clone this repository
2. Install Python 3.x
3. Install Pygame: `pip install pygame`
4. Navigate to any project folder and run: `python main.py`

## 📝 Learning Notes

- **From Scratch Philosophy**: Each project is built completely from scratch to maximize learning
- **Progressive Complexity**: Each project builds on concepts from previous ones
- **Practical Focus**: Every project results in a playable prototype

## 🎯 Future Plans

- Integration with AI/ML for intelligent game mechanics
- Potential YouTube series documenting the learning journey
- Possible port to Unity for comparison and advanced 3D features
